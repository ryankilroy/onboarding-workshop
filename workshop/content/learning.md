Now that you have an Educates deployment, you can start making/modifying a workshop!

You can reference the on workshop creation here.
```dashboard:create-dashboard
name: Edukates Docs - Workshop Config
url: https://docs.edukates.io/en/latest/workshop-content/workshop-config.html
```

There's also a sample workshop you can reference from on Github.
```dashboard:open-url
url: https://github.com/eduk8s/lab-markdown-sample
```

But what I'd like you to do is modify *this* workshop, and add your mark to it!

You've already met the team, so go ahead and add yourself! And have a little fun with it too!

```execute
echo "git clone whatever repo this ends up in"
echo "Also we will need to figure out how to include push-pull credentials here for new members to modify the Workshop in this Workshop."
```

You can clone the repo on your local machine if you'd like, but Educates actually comes with a VS Code editor and Terminal, so you can also do it all here as well!
