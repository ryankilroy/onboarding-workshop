This is! You're looking at it!

Educates is an open-source project created by [Graham Dumpleton](https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton), [Jorge Morales Pou](https://github.com/jorgemoralespou), and [Grant Shipley](https://github.com/gshipley). The goal of Educates is self-explanatory, but in essence, it is a way to make, deploy, and run Kubernetes (k8s) workshops really easily!

It can do a lot of cool and nifty things. For example, click on this box below:

```execute
echo "You can execute this command by clicking me!"
```

There are a bunch of really interesting and effective educational tools that Educates enables workshop authors to use, but we'll get into that more a bit later.
